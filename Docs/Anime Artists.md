##big titty anon's notes
wlop in base 1.4 sucks ass, in WD he's pretty good it seems, though as said the floor was raised dramatically.
Cedric Peyravernay whose girls are somehow hot by only using him even in base 1.4 which I really didn't expect from a dishonored artist.
Michael Garmash turns all faces into those of goddesses. Artgerm in base 1.4 is amazing, in WD he isn't really necessary.
Justin Gerard adds a really nice fantasy feel that I feel none of the others do.
ismail inceoglu add a sci-fi feel that needs to be coupled with another artist to tame it a bit.
Stephan Martinere makes things like clothes really shiny, which is nice and I think he's the only one who does that.

##anime vector anon's notes on waifu diffusion
1: As you might expect from it's name, WD works wonderfully for generating anime girls; however, it capably handles other things as well, such as scenery.
2: Vectors and prompts that worked in SD will typically work in WD, with the exception of photos or realism.
3: Because photos do not work well with WD, real world anime merchandise such as nendos and figmas are better done in SD.
4: Since WD outputs are already going to be illustrations, there is no need for vectors such as 'illustration' or 'digital painting'; the use of these vectors adds very little to an overall prompt, or even detracts from it.
5: Personally recommended quality control vectors are variations of 'artstation' (such as 'arstation girl' or 'trending on artstation') and 'highly detailed'. These can safely be added to most prompts.
6: Unsurprisingly, 'face' and 'hand' seem to be the best vectors for faces and hands. For full body, 'artstation female body' works well; 'male body artstation' if you're some kinda prancing lala homo man. For a focus on specific body parts, just ask for that body part.
7: If you ask for booba, milk truck arrive; even a vector like 'flat chest' is going to give your girl huge badonkers. If you want the itty bitty titty committee, go for vectors like 'loli', or invoke the names of flat chested characters.
8: Vectors like 'curvaceous' are often redundant since WD will default to shapely ladies.
9: Like in SD, furries, monster girls, elves and more can be made in WD (with some luck and patience).
10: If SD doesn't know a vector, WD doesn't know it either. Thus, for the time being, we are still stuck without a lot of wonderful artists like Satoshi Urushihara and Happoubi Jin.

##anime vector anon's notes, part 2
1: Characters can mostly be recreated with enough effort, time, and luck. Vaguely describe the character—their colors, clothes, age, body type, etc—and then potentially add one or two artists whose style you find agreeable. For more popular or recognizable characters, you could also add in their name or the series they're from.
2: Vectors can be overlapped to some interesting ends. For example, if you throw in a dozen different animals, you're not going to get an image with all of those animals in it—you're going to get a fantastical creature with elements from several of them all at the same time. You may have noticed this already by trying to create things like catgirls, but the uses extend further than this—clothes, for example. If you give the AI multiple outfits to work with, it's going to combine them in unexpected ways to give you uniquely dressed characters.
3: Some vectors have unexpected use case scenarios. For example, I'd originally listed Idolmaster in mid tier; while my opinion on its overall quality is unchanged, it's a worthy vector if you're aiming for a group shot with multiple characters in it.
4: This may require further testing, but the advent of WD and similar anime models seems to have boosted the effectiveness and/or quality of lower tier vectors. Preliminary results have been promising.
5: If you have access to negative prompts, USE THEM. My generic list for making anime booba:
bad anatomy, disfigured, deformed, malformed, mutant, monstrous, ugly, gross, disgusting, man, male, boy, old, blurry, fat, obese, out of frame, poorly drawn, extra limbs, extra fingers, missing limbs
