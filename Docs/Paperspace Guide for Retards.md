### Getting Started on Paperspace for Retards <3

**What is Paperspace?**

Basically, a cloud compute service for AI development. You run your code on their hardware.




**Why Paperspace?**

Paperspace makes it easy to run resource-intensive, long-running AI calculations. Paperspace is convenient, free, and you probably don't have a computer good enough to run the AI. 

You'll run your code on their powerful GPUs which is much faster and easier than locally on your computer.



**Do I have to pay?**

Only if you feel limited by their free tier. You should have everything you need to generate ~~porn~~ really neat images.



**Why not Google Colab?**

Google Colab is an alternative, but their free tier is more restrictive than Paperspace's and has less powerful hardware.
