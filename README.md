```

Or, download the notebook file: [StableDiffusionUI_Voldemort_paperspace.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Engineer-of-Stuff/stable-diffusion-paperspace/master/StableDiffusionUI_Voldemort_paperspace.ipynb)

This notebook is designed to automate pretty much the entire process of getting your WebUI set up.

### A note about Python 3.10

Python 3.10 is the recommended Python version for running the WebUI. If you encounter any issues, maybe running the WebUI in Python 3.10 will help? Paperspace uses Python 3.9 so you must run a custom container.

If you have already created a machine, delete it and create a new one following these instructions: https://docs.paperspace.com/gradient/notebooks/runtimes/#how-to-specify-a-custom-container

Make sure to use this container image: `cyberes/gradient-base-py3.10:latest`
